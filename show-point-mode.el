;;; Change log:

;;
;; Version 0.1
;; * initial release



;;; Code:

(provide 'show-point-mode)

(defun point-format-line ()
  (if (eobp)
      (format "(%d: EOF)" (point))
    (format "(%d: #%x, '%c')" (point) (char-after) (char-after))))

;; add point display to mode-line construct
(let ((linenum-format (assq 'line-number-mode mode-line-position)))
  (setq mode-line-position
        (assq-delete-all 'line-number-mode mode-line-position))
  (setq mode-line-position
        (append mode-line-position
                `((show-point-mode
                   (line-number-mode
                    ((column-number-mode
                      (20 (" (%l,%c)" (:eval (point-format-line))))
                      (15 (" L%l"     (:eval (point-format-line))))))
                    ((column-number-mode
                      (15 (" C%c"     (:eval (point-format-line))))
                      (10 (:eval (point-format-line))))))
                   ,linenum-format)))))


(define-minor-mode show-point-mode
  "Toggle show-point mode.
With no argument, this command toggles the mode.
A non-null prefix argument turns the mode on.
A null prefix argument turns it off.

Note that simply setting the minor-mode variable
`show-point-mode' is not sufficient to enable show-point-mode
mode.

When enabled, the value of `point' is displayed in the
mode-line (after the line and column numbers, if those are being
displayed too)."
  :global t)

;;; show-point-mode.el ends here
